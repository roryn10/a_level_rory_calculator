Widgets: -'QWidget' is the base class for all user interface objects (widgets)
         - Rectangular shaped graphical components that you place on your application's window to construct the GUI
         - A widget contains a series of attributes and methods that allow you to model their appearance and behavior
         - Can receive mouse clicks, keypresses and other events from the user, window system or elsewhere
         - Common widgets: - Buttons      :  'QPushButton'
                           - Labels       :  'QLabel'
                           - Line edits   :  'QLineEdit'    : Used to enter data in plaintext. Perfect for entering the functions to be mapped
                           - Combo boxes  :  'QComboBox'    : Basically a dropdown box, useful for saving space
                           - Radio buttons:  'QRadioButton' : Used when the user has to select one option from many. Only one option can be selected at a given time


Layout managers: - Classes that allow you to size and position your widgets on an application form
                 - Automatically adapt to resize events and content changes
                 - This all means that widgets in a layout are automatically resized whenever the form is resized
                 - 4 Basic layout managers: - 'QHboxLayout' : Arranges widgets horizontally from left to right
                                            - 'QVBoxLayout' : Arranges widgets vertically from top to bottom
                                            - 'QGridLayout' : Arranges widgets in a grid starting at the top left as (0,0) finishing in the bottom right as (n, n).
                                                -> E.g. layout.addWidget(QPushButton('First button'), 0, 0, 2, 3)  Would create a button in position (0,0) with rowSpan of 2 and columnSpan of 3
                                            - 'QFormLayout' : Arranges widgets in a two-column layout. The first column usually consists of labels whilst the second column usually consists of field widgets
                                                -> Perfect for creating forms to be filled in
